## Note
Now that Angular 2 has been officially released, this probably does not work due to changes in Angular 2 API.

## Instructions

To run the app:

1.	Run `npm install`
2.	If you don't have Gulp, install Gulp CLI `npm install -g gulp-cli`
3.	Run `gulp serve`. This will transpile TypeScript to JS, copy some stuff over and launch the app in your browser.


## Implementation

The app is based on [existing TodoMVC Angular 2 app](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/angular2),
but adds routing, which is missing in the existing app.

Uses TodoMVC template.

Hope you find it useful!
